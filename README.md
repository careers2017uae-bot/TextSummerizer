# TextSummerizer
Text summarization is a natural language processing (NLP) task that analyzes a body of text and produces a shorter version containing the key ideas. This is useful for getting quick summaries of items like articles, academic papers, book chapters or sections, lengthy emails, reports, study materials, product reviews and more.
